<OL>
	<LI> <B>What is TeamBots?</B>
		<P>
		TeamBots is a system for developing and 
		running multi-robot control systems on mobile robots and in
		simulation. TeamBots is freely distributable, 
		but it is copyrighted by the Georgia Tech Research
		Corporation.
		TeamBots was developed at Georgia Tech's 
		Intelligent Systems and Robotics Group by Tucker Balch,
		Juan Carlos Santamaría and David Huggins. 
	<P>
	<LI> <B>How do I get the TeamBots distribution?</B>
		<P>
		Download it from 
		<A HREF="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~trb/TeamBots">
		http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~trb/TeamBots</A>
	<P>
	<LI> <B>How do I install TeamBots?</B>
		<P>
		Instructions are on the main page: 
		<A HREF="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~trb/TeamBots">
		http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~trb/TeamBots</A>
	<P>
	<LI> <B>What software do I need to install and run TeamBots?</B>
		<P>
		Unzip and Java 1.2 or newer.  You need gmake if you 
		want to (elegantly) revise and recompile.
	<P>
	<LI> <B>Where can I find the meaning and arguments to the keywords 
		used in the dsc-files?</B>
		<P>
		Probably the best source is the example file in 
		<A HREF="../Domains/Forage/forage.dsc">Forage/forage.dsc</A>.
		It is fairly well documented.
	<P>
	<LI> <B>What happens after the dsc-file is read? 
		How is the machinery started? In which order are
		takeStep() methods called. When is draw called?</B>
		<P>
		<OL>
		<LI> Each robot's control system takeStep() method is called.
		<LI> Each physical object in the simulation's 
			takeStep() method is called.
		<LI> Each object in the simulation's draw() method is called.
		</OL>
		<P>
		Robots have two components, the physical part and 
		the control system part.  Both have takeStep() methods 
		that are called on every cycle.
	<P>
	<LI> <B> I want to make multiple simulation runs without 
		intervention. How can I restart the simulation and
		save results?</B>
		<P>
		Use the "timeout" and "trials" keywords in the 
		description file.  "timeout 10000" for example, will
		run the simulation for 10 seconds, then terminate 
		the simulation.  If you also add a "trials 100" statement,
		then your simulation will run 10 seconds 100 times.
		Note that the trialEnd(), trialInit() and quit() methods
		of your control system will be called at the appropriate
		times.  This allows you to log data and open and close
		files as the need arises. quit() is only called once at
		the end of the simulation.
		<P>
		You may also want to run your simulation using 
		TBSimNoGraphics instead of TBSim.  This
		program runs about 10 times as fast but with no graphics.
	<P>
	<LI> <B>Can I run TBSim without the graphics?</B>
		<P>
		Yes.  Use the TBSimNoGraphics application instead
		of TBSim.  The program runs about 10 times
		as fast.  The command line is 
		<PRE>java TBSimNoGraphics description_file</PRE>
	<P>
	<LI> <B>Can TBSim be
		run as an applet (i.e., from a web browser), if 
		only for a demonstration?</B>
		<P>
		Maybe.  There is a working version of TMSim designed
		to run as an applet (TBSimApplet). 
		The reason for the uncertainty is that
		TeamBots requires Java 1.2 support and under Linux
		(where TeamBots is developed), Netscape does not seem
		to fully support the 1.2 AWT, so it can't be tested.
		<P>
		Testing and debugging this feature is
		definitely on the ``to do'' list for the
		next release.
	<P>
	<LI> <B>Isn't Java really slow?  How can you use it for
		real time control?</B>
		<P>
		Some researchers are concerned that Java is too 
		slow to support real time robot control. 
		Our experience contradicts this conclusion. 
		As an example, in simulation (without graphics) 
		our Java coded behavior-based control systems 
		run at up to 30 KHz rates on conventional 200 MHz 
		Pentium machines. 
		<P>
		The primary bottleneck to runtime efficiency on 
		real robots is sensor and control I/O. On Nomad 
		150 robots for instance, we are limited to 10Hz 
		control rates because this is the maximum rate 
		control commands can be transmitted to the 
		robot (control programs written in C cannot 
		run any faster). 
		<P>
		The benefits of Java (portability, correctness, ease 
		of use, rapid development) far outweigh the 
		negligible runtime overhead. 
		<P>
		Finally, Java compilers that offer runtime speeds
		as fast as C++ are already available (take a look
		at the compiler by 
		<A HREF="http://www.towerj.com">Tower</A>
		for instance).
