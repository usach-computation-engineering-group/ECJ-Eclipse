Nomad 150 example README

This directory contains a simple demo called "Sonar Bounce". 
 
To get started quickly, plug the robot "Host" port into COM port 2 of
your host computer and run "sobounce".  The robot should "zero" its
steering and turret axes and begin to move about.  The sonar bounce
program simply moves forward until an obstacle is sensed and turns
until the obstacle is no longer in front and continues.
   
The contents of this directory are intended and compiled for Linux 
machines communicating through the default COM serial port at 9600 baud.  
Currently the default is COM port 2.  This can be changed by changing 
DEFAULT_COMPORT in line 97 of Ndirect.c and recompiling -- or -- 
by calling open_serial(NEW_COMPORT, 9600) in the client program immediately
after calling connect_robot().  

Ndirect.c:
This is a general file that should be compiled and linked to 
your client programs so that they can communicate with the 150.  

sobounce.c:
This is the source to sonar bounce.
